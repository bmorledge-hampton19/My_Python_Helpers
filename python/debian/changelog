python3-benbiohelpers (1.2-0ubuntu1) focal; urgency=medium

  * Changes to Tkinter UIs
    - Added "with as" functionality to basic tkinter dialog and dynamic selectors.
    - Auto-acquiring files within the multiple file selecter can use "basename contains" logic instead of just "endswith".
  * Created some new short helper scripts
    - Created ParseToIterable for parsing raw text, potentially with ranges, to an iterable.
    - Created CombineReps for automatically merging files that are different repetitions for the same data cohort.
    - Created GetFileSubset for subsetting files for testing, particularly fastq files, which have to be subsetted
      in such a way that avoids the low quality reads at the beginning.
    - Created GetLineCount for quickly getting the number of lines in a file through python.
    - Created ExpandSequenceContext for generating expanded sequences from a bed file.
  * Changes to existing short helper scripts
    - FastaEntry objects from the FastaFileIterator now have an option to create fasta-formatted output from themselves.
    - Added additional MetadataErrors to the CustomErrors script to accomodate the new Metadata data structure.
  * Created the Metadata data structure
    - Will be useful for managing metadata in larger projects.
    - Contains unit tests for added stability.
    - Will probably change more as it gets used. This is still very much a prototype.
  * Updates to ThisInThatCounter
    - Added new supplemental information handler for getting simple information from a specific column.
    - Added a new method for creating supplemental information handlers with more modular inputs to accomodate the above.
    - Added options for masking (omitting) final counts in output.
  * As always, there are changes that are too small to merit putting here or that I'm simply forgetting.
    Check Github commit notes for further info.
